A report for the emergency preparedness and protective services committee show 298,918 parking tickets 
were issued in 2023, down from 340,625 parking tickets in 2022.  If you were unfortunate enough to have
received a ticket, you have 3 options.  

Option 1 is to pay your fine (online, in person or by telephone).  If you choose to pay your fine, you 
are done with this unfortunate event.  

Option 2 is to review your parking by submitting an application for a Screening Officer to review.  The 
screening officer will determine whether your ticket is valid (in which you have to pay your fine) or invalid 
(in which your ticket will be closed with no fine).  The decision will be based on the information provided 
in your review application.

If you're not satisfied with the outcome of your review (your ticket was determined to be valid), you may 
proceed to Option 3, which is to request a trial date by submitting a Notice of Intention to Appear (NIA) form.  
Once this form is submitted, a trial date will be assigned to you.
